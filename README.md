# gameleader
Gameleader Quake 2 is a totally different Quake 2 modification. It is something of a hybrid between normal Deathmatch and single player mode, and I don't mean any Co-op by saying this.

In Gameleader Quake there is a gameleader as the name strongly suggests. The gameleader tries to prevent the other players from getting to the end by spawning monsters wherever he (or she) sees fit. Any monsters featured in normal Q2 are available for the gameleader to be used as lethal obstacles between the players and the target zone.

In opposition to the solitary gameleader with huge packs of monsters there are the poor "players". These brave marines will have to fight the monsters, each other, traps and occationally even the gameleader! They will have to clear their way through the corridors and elevators, halls and bridges without any safe haven, without any refuge, always watching their back AND their front.

As only one can be the best the players will have to compete with each other to win the round. The gameleader tries to stop the players without losing too much of his (or her) valuable cells, gaining cells for each player slain.
